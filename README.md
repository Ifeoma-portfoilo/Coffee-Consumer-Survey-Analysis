# Coffee Consumer Survey Analysis
### Project Overview
This project analyzes consumer's coffee consumption habits, spending patterns, and lifestyle habits among consumers using a detailed survey dataset.

## Objectives
- Understand how Demograpics (age, gender, education, employment, income) influence coffee consumption.
- Identify common Coffee drinking habits, such as frequency, location, and preferred brewing methods.
- Analyze spending patterns and how they relate to demographics and behavioral factors.
- Design an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes consumer insights clearly and effectively.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
All data transformation and preparation were done using Power Query in Power BI.
Key cleaning steps includes;
- Handling missing and null values.
- Replacing inconsistent text entries and standardizing responses.
- Splitting Age Range into 'Age_Min' and 'Age_Max' to create numeric insights.
- Converting categorical values (e.g. "Yes/No", "Less than 1 cup") to logical or numeric formats
- Unpivoting multi-select columns (e.g. drinking locayions, brewing methods) for normalization.
- Creating relationship tables ans linking via 'Respondent_ID'.

## Analysis and Insights
### Demographics
- Older respondents consume coffee more frequently than younger respondents.
- Male Respondents spend more on coffee monthly than females
- Respondents with advanced degrees (Doctorate/Professional) spend the most on coffee.

### Coffee Habits
- Coffee is consumed more often at home than any other location.
- Employed respondents drink coffee more regularly than unemloyed or students.
- The majority of respondents drink coffee for alertness and productivity.

### Spending Patterns
- Coffee spending increases with income and education levels.
- Some respondents drink coffee frequently but spend less, implying home preparation habits.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: for data modeling and dashboard creation.
- **Power Query** for data cleaning, transformation and column management.

## What I Learnt
- Clean and transform a large dataset using Power Query in Power BI.
‎- Create relationships between tables, handle unpivoted columns, and design a dashboard that tells a story.
‎- Derive meaningful insights from complex, multi-select survey data.
